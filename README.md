# Pet project: King tricks calculator

Tricks points and party score calculator for card game "King"

# About the game

Game King is a game for 4 people. It uses a deck of 32 cards (from seven to ace). Each player receives 8 cards in his hand.

The first player to start the games is determined by the order of entry in the table. All players move clockwise in turn order.

There are two varieties of King: forced (short) and bet (long). This calculator is developed for a "bet's King" version of the game.

In bet's King, each player in a party bets (chooses) one of 14 types of parties. Each player can choose only one type of party. He is also obliged to select all types of parties once. You need to play 56 hands to complete the game.
